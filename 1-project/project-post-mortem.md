## Project Post Mortem

Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

### What to Bring

Please answer the following questions. Take at least 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

I thought I got off to a good start, I had things planned out but execution-wise turned out to be different. Nonetheless, it was a great experience working full-stack, albeit a simple one.

1. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
   Some logic applied here in this project would be my takeaway. Managed to work with my database columns in ensuring a certain set of data was extracted from the db based on my code logic.

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
   I will probably implement components to better structure my code.

1. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
   i did a lot more css and I thought I did ok. There is still room for improvement. I will also learn to make more git commits to reduce errors.

For each, please include code examples.

1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
